# Asteroids - A simple implementation of the Asteroids game in Java

### Features ###

* Complete playable game with lives, levels, and basic scoring
* Classes used per-object in game world
* Uses Java AWT for vector graphics
* Basic keyboard player controls

### About ###

I developed this game both as an exercise in helping to re-learn the basics of
Java coding, as well as for learning how to implement a game in Java.

Prior to this exercise, my exposure to Java had only been small experiments here
and there; a bit of PhoneGap changes and updates, some brief wanderings, and a
bit of other dabbling in employer-related codebases that needed modification.

Java never concerned me as far a being a software developer was concerned, since
to me it's "just another language". That's how I typically approach matters, and
will learn a language as the need and application of it suits the task.

In this case, I had the idea that I wanted to do some native Android development,
and for that you need to have more than "just a bit" of Java familiarity, so in
order to get to that level, I figured a game would be a good way to start. Also,
since the Android app I had in mind was also going to be a game that was going
to be vector-graphics based, Asteroids seemed like a good fit.

### Compiling and Running ###

Pretty basic: javac asteroids/Asteroids.java; java asteroids.Asteroids

* Left/Right arrows control the direction of your craft
* Up arrow adds thrust
* Spacebar fires your weapon

### TODO ###

* Fix initialization of asteroids to leave clear "center" for player's craft
* Fix key-handling code (laggy)
* Shields
* Sound
* Enemy ship
* High score list
* Dual-player (?)
